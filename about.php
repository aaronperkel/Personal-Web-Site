                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been playing piano since I was 6 years old. In middle school, 
                    I also picked up the Alto Saxophone and played in the Symphonic and 
                    Marching Bands.

                <h3>Photography and Film Making</h3>
                <p>
                    I have also loved making movies and documenting things via video 
                    for as long as I've known how to use a camera. I occasionally 
                    upload these videos to my 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aaronperkel" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Aviation</h3>
                <p>
                    My biggest passion outside of school is aviation. I have been determined 
                    to become a pilot as long as I can remember. Currently, I achieve 
                    this passion by spending my time on 
                    <a href="https://vatsim.net/" target="_blank">Vatsim</a>.

                    VATSIM (short for the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network) is a 
                    completely free online platform which allows virtual pilots, wherever 
                    they are in the world, to connect their flight simulators into one 
                    shared virtual world. VATSIM also simulates air traffic control in 
                    this virtual world, creating the ultimate as-real-as-it-gets experience 
                    for you, the virtual aviation enthusiast.
