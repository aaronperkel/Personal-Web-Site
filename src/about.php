        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Richmond, Virginia, but spent most of my childhood in
            Macon, Georgia, where I attended a small private school from first
            grade through high school. Growing up, I developed a deep love for
            both technology and aviationâ€”two passions that have shaped my life.
            After high school, I took a leap and headed to the University of Vermont,
            where I'm now in my final year studying Computer Science with a Mathematics
            minor.
        </p>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I have been playing piano since I was 6 years old. In middle school,
            I also picked up the Alto Saxophone and played in the Symphonic and
            Marching Bands.
        </p>

        <h3>Photography and Film Making</h3>
        <p>
            I have also loved making movies and documenting things via video
            for as long as I've known how to use a camera. I occasionally
            upload these videos to my
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aaronperkel" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Aviation</h3>
        <p>
            My biggest passion outside of school is aviation. I have been determined
            to become a pilot as long as I can remember. Currently, I achieve
            this passion by spending my time on
            <a href="https://vatsim.net/" target="_blank">Vatsim</a>.

            VATSIM (short for the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network) is a
            completely free online platform which allows virtual pilots, wherever
            they are in the world, to connect their flight simulators into one
            shared virtual world. VATSIM also simulates air traffic control in
            this virtual world, creating the ultimate as-real-as-it-gets experience
            for you, the virtual aviation enthusiast.

        <p>
            I currently hold my PPL rating on Vatsim with just over
            <a href="https://stats.vatsim.net/stats/1317676" target="_blank">
                350 flying hours logged</a>.
            I also have recently achieved my S1 Controller rating from
