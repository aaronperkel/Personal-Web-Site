            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>Hey! I’m Aaron Perkel — a computer science graduate from the University of Vermont, 
                where I earned my degree in just three years along with a minor in math. I 
                currently work as a Network Technician at UVM. I’ve been admitted to Middle 
                Georgia State University for an M.S. in Management with a concentration in 
                Aviation Management, hoping to bridge the gap between tech and aviation. 
                I’m passionate about building practical tools, automating workflows, and 
                understanding systems from the ground up — whether that’s managing networks, 
                coding full-stack projects, or flying on VATSIM. I’m also planning to begin the 
                ATC process soon, and maybe pursue becoming a pilot in the next few years.</p>

            <h3>Music & Creativity</h3>
            <p>I’ve been playing piano since age 6 and picked up alto sax in middle school, performing in symphonic and
                marching bands. Off‐screen, I love crafting short films and photography—check out my <a
