                where I finished my degree in just three years with a minor in math. I currently work 
                as a Network Technician at UVM. This fall, I’m starting an M.S. in Management at 
                Middle Georgia State University, focusing on Aviation Management to help bridge 
                my passions for tech and aviation. I'm into building useful tools, automating workflows, 
                and understanding systems from the ground up — whether that's managing networks, 
                developing full-stack apps, or flying on VATSIM. I’m also planning to begin the ATC 
                process soon, and maybe go for a pilot’s license down the line."
